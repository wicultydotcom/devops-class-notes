Git Architecture
- end-to-end git work-flow

#
Creating remote repository in github
===============
1. create an account in github.com
	URL: https://github.com

2. login github.com with your credentials. 	
	click on "new" --> give a name "flipkart-ecomerce" --> "create reopository" 

3. copy the repo URL from Github:
	https://github.com/nageshvkn/flipkart-ecomerce.git

4. Clone the source code from remote repository using 'git clone' command
	git clone https://github.com/nageshvkn/flipkart-ecomerce.git

5. cd "flipkart-ecomerce" and observe ".git" folder. ".git" is called as "Local Reposiotory".

6. Create some sample code and submit the code to remote repo.
	--> touch Login.java
	--> git add Login.java
	--> git commit Login.java -m "login module code"
	--> git push  --> [refer below topic to generate token as password]

	--> git log Login.java

#
Settng up token to access GitHub
========================================
1. go to https://github.com

2. Generate toke from github
click on user-profile icon (top right) .. click on 'settings' .. click on 'Developer settings' .. click on 'Personal access tokens' .. click on 'Generate new token' .. give a name under 'Note' (example:class) .. select 'No expiration' from 'Expiration' drop-down box .. click on 'repo' check box under 'Select scopes' .. and finally click on 'Generate token' button.

3. Store the token in your machine using below command
$ git remote set-url origin https://nageshvkn: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@github.com/nageshvkn/wiculty29.git

Note: in the above command
- 'nageshvkn' is your GitHub user-name.
- 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 IS your token generated from GitHub.
- github.com/nageshvkn/wiculty29.git is your repository path. don't give 'https'

#
Staging Index/Stage

- Skip staging
	$ git commit -am "submit all pending changes"

Note: If you want to skip the staging, you need to commit all pending changes.
      For new file, you have to go throgh the 'stage' process.


# Show all the files that are modified as part of a commit (with content)
git show <Commit Id>
git show b85a6e123


#
- Git Commit structure
	SHA value / commit ID
	User & email
	Date & time stamp
	Commit message
	 
# How SHA is generated?
SHA / Version / Revison / Commit Id


#
Setting up mandatory configurations:
=============================================
$ git config --global user.name "Nageswara Rao P"
$ git config --global user.email "nageshvkn@gmail.com"

Check the configurations using below command
$ git config --list

Git stores all configurations in below file
"$USER_HOME/.gitconfig"


# Understand Git Jargon.
	- Remote Repository
	- Working Directory
	- Local Repository
	- Stage/"Staging Index"
	- SHA

# History
	$ git log Login.java
	$ git log

# List all the commits made by an user
        $ git log --author="harry" 
        
# List all the commits based on the commit message
        $ git log --grep="math function"
        
#Qn.
Show me all commits made by user "harry" AND has a commit message "math function" in it.

$ git log --author="harry" --grep="math function"


# GIT Commands
1.  
# See the content change of a file which is in 'source' area
$ git diff Login.java

# See the content change of a file which is in 'stage' area
$ git diff --staged Login.java

# See the content change of a file after the commit
$ git show 123abc456
$ git diff 123abc..345abc


2. Deleting a file

        A.) git rm OMS.java
	    git commit OMS.java -m "comment"
	    git push
	    
 
3. Renaming a file/folder
	A.) git mv Login.java Login1.java
	    git commit -m "rename Login"
	    git push		
Note:
Git will carry the history of old file to new file. To check complete history..
	$ git log --follow Login1.java


# Undoing the changes:
undo/revert local changes from source area
	$ git checkout -- LoginWeb.java

Unstage the changes from STAGE area
	$ git reset LoginWeb.java


# BRANCHING
	A. What is a branch?
	B. Why and When we create a branch?
	C. Branching Stratogies

# List all active branches in local repository
	$ git branch
	
# Creating a new branch
	$ git branch dev_1.2.3

# Push new branch to remote repository
	$ git push origin dev_1.2.3
		
# Switching from one branch to another
	$ git checkout dev_1.2.3

# Creating and switching to a newly created branch
	$ git checkout -b dev_1.2.4

# How do you clone a remote repository with a particular branch as default
	$ git clone -b dev_1.2.4 https://github.com/nageshvkn/flipkart899.git

# List all remote branches
	$ git branch -r
	
# Deleting a branch
        $ git branch -d dev_1.2.3
        $ git push -d origin dev_1.2.3       


MERGING:
=================

# List all the branches
	$ git branch

# Create a new branch
	$ git branch dev_1.2.3


# Take a file which is common in master and dev_1.2.3 branch.
  ex: Login.java

# Make sure Login.java has below content in master and dev_1.2.3 branch
	Login.java
		line#5 --> int a = 10;
	
# To create a conflict situation, we need to modify same line in two branches with different content.

	ex: Login.java (master)
			line#5 --> int a =100;
		
		Login.java (dev_1.2.3)
			line#5 --> int a = 200;


# Now merge the code from dev_1.2.3 to master branch
  Before merge, make sure that you are on target branch i.e master (source branch: dev_1.2.3)
	$ git checkout master

# You have master code now, since currently checkout branch is master. Now bring/merge the changes from dev_1.2.3 to master by running below command. 
Git merge command merges the changes from dev_1.2.3 to master.

	$ git merge dev_1.2.3

# Run git status command to list conflict file

#
  Resolve the conflict and commit the merge

# Run git push command to move the merge to Remote.


# What is Conflict:
If two users modify the same file in source and target branches and if the same line has different content, git can't decide which user's code it has to take. we call this situation as conflict.

# How do you resolve the conflict: 
- Open the conflict file--> remove conflict markers--> select the right content 
  based on the discussion with developers
- git add
- git commit (after compilation and some z sanity testing)
- git push

Note:
Use below command to find the owner of conflict code. How do you find the user who modified/added conflicted code?
        - $ git checkout master
          $ git blame Login.java
          
        - $ git checkout dev_1.2.3
          $ git blame Login.java

#
How to push a particular commit to remote?
$ git push origin 3160a392f3844d117289e248b5a910c38e646a1f:master
Syntax: $ git push origin <Commit-ID>:branch


NOTES:
SVN & Git differences:
==========================
- Centralized VCS -  Ex: CVS/SVN/Clearcase/Perforce
- Distributed VCS -  Ex: GIT/Bitkeeper

1.
SVN is a centralised version control system. In svn, when a user checkout’s the repository, he will get only the source code. Repository is not distributed to the user. In SVN multiple users connect to a single/centralized server. If that server goes down, no user will be able to work.

	Where as Git is distributed VCS. In the sense, when user clones the repository, he will get source code as well as complete repository on his local disk. since repository is distributed across multiple users and each user has their own local repository, user will be able to submit the changes locally without connecting to the master server. (i.e he can also work offline)

2.
Git has staging area. Users can leverage this staging area to stage/save all the changes related to some issue/bug and  commit everything at once into local repository. hence, all the changes will be recorded as part of single sha/commit. user's get an opportunity to logically group the changes and commit as single changeset. this enables better tracking.

3.
Since git is distributed in nature, almost all transactions happen locally in the client machine and hence less overhead on the server so git is faster.

3A.
Users are free to create any no. branches in Git. where as in svn, all branches reside in server side, so you may have multiple branches unnecessarily in SVN Remote.

4.
Git seems to be good with merging.

5.
Git stores each change as SHA values but SVN uses simple numbers as revisions.


Qns:
====
Is token user related or project/repository related?

can we have different token for different repository?
