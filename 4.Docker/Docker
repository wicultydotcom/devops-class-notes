		Docker - The Container Virtualization Tool
	     ==================================================
Day-1:
###############
#
Diff between..
- Physical server
- Virtual machine
- Docker container

VM, Docker, usage in DevOps.

#
what is docker? why docker?

#
Supported Platforms -
	- Docker is supported on
		- Linux platforms
			Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOs..etc.
		- Windows  
		- OS X 		
		  
	- Cloud Platforms
		Amazon EC2
		Rackspace Cloud
		Google compute Engine..etc.
		Azure

Note:
Linux containers can be created on Windows and OS X.
HOW?- Windows & Mac Docker installers contain a tiny Linux virtual machine.
So, Docker creates linux container on top of this tiny Linux VM.

Requirements:
	- 64-bit architecture	  
	- Linux 3.8 or later Kernel versions

#
Requirements Check:
- Check Kernel version
	$ uname -a
	$ uname -r

- Check OS name:
	$ lsb_release -a / -cs
	$ cat /etc/os-release	


Installation Steps:
=====================	
# To install the Docker, Run below commands
Reference: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu

        $ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
        $ sudo sh get-docker.sh

	
#
Installation Check
sudo docker --version

#
If you would like to use Docker as a non-root user, you should add your user to the “docker” group with below command.

  sudo usermod -aG docker <your-user>
  
check if the user is added to the group
$ cat /etc/group | grep docker
docker:x:998:wiculty

Note - restart the machine once the user is added to the group.

#
uninstall docker:
$ sudo apt-get purge docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
$ sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker (Removes all containers and images)


DAY-2
#
Managing docker containers
===============================
# Create a new container using below command

$ docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
------------------
- "docker run" command provides all lanuching capabilities for docker to create a container.
- we use `docker run` to create new containers.

-i  : opens STDIN from the container
-t  : tells docker to assign a terminal to the container.
-it : provides interactive shell
	
ubuntu : Is an image and also called as "stock image" or "base image".
	This image will be downloaded from Docker hub when we run 'docker run' 
			  command first time.	
/bin/bash: 'shell program' that will be installed in the terminal.


# Inspect the new container.. Let's believe that it's separate machine
1.
	hostname
2.
	cat /etc/hosts

3. hostname -i

5. ps -ef

6. cd / && pwd && ls


# SSH setup for containers
By default, containers won't be having SSH installation. But, SSH almost mandatory in order to connect to a remote machine of if remote machine wants to connect to the container. Let's setup SSH in the container.

- Create a new container
$ docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash [run ssh command. It's missing!]
- Install SSH in the container
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install ssh [This installs both SSH client and Server]

- Start the SSH server
$ service ssh start (status/stop/restart)

- Create an user and set up password
$ used -m -d /home/gamut -s /bin/bash gamut
$ passwd gamut
	
- Connect to the container using below command from the host machine.
$ ssh gamut@172.17.0.3

#
Shotdown a container
"exit" to stop the container

#
Login to a stopped container
	$ docker start
	$ docker attach
        $ docker start -ai mystifying_tu

# List all containers(stopped and running)
$ docker cotainer ls -a
$ docker ps -a


# List given no. of containers
$ docker ps -n1

# List running containers only
$ sudo docker cotainer ls
$ docker ps

# List Stopped containers only
$ docker container ls -f status=exited (Where Status can be exited/running)


# "docker ps -a" command output shows
	- Image name from which container is created
	- ID - container can be identified using short UUID, longer UUID Or name.
	- Status of the container (Up / Exited)
	- Name of the container

# show the last container which you have created (stopped/running)
sudo docker container ls -l

# Naming the container
	docker run --name gamut -it ubuntu /bin/bash

Note: Two containers can't have the same name.

# Rename a container
$ docker rename db-server3 db-server-name3

# Deleting a container by giving it's name or ID
$ docker rm ID/name

# Delete all (running/stoped) containers at once
 $ docker rm -f $(docker container ls -a -q)
 $ docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q)


# Delete running containers only
$ docker rm -f $(docker container ls -q)
$ docker rm -f $(docker ps -q)


# list stopped containers only
$ docker container ls -a -f status=exited

# Starting a stopped container
	sudo docker start gamut
	sudo docker stop <container-name>
	sudo docker restart gamut

# Attaching to a running container
	docker attach gamut
	docker attach b1b1c8dc1939


# Run a linux command remotely in a container
$ docker exec -it tomcat-server ps -ef

#
Get an independent terminal from a container remotely (from Host)
$ docker exec -it tomcat-server /bin/bash


# Shortcut Keys
	Ctrl + p + q - push a running container in background mode.
	Ctrl + d -  short cut to 'stop' a container.


# Create a container in a background mode ( without termial access ) 
$ docker run -it -d ubuntu /bin/bash


STATS:
==========
# Display usage statistics of a container
	$ docker stats <container-name>
	$ docker stats --no-stream <container-name>
	$ docker stats --no-stream --all

	$ docker stats --no-stream --format {{.MemUsage}} sleepy_shannon
	$ docker stats --no-stream --format {{.CPUPerc}} sleepy_shannon

#
Allocating memory for a container (below command allocates 1 GB RAM)
	$ docker run -it --name tomcat-server -m 1g ubuntu /bin/bash
	$ docker run -it --name tomcat-server -m 512m ubuntu /bin/bash 

#
Updating memory of an existing container 
	$ docker update -m 2024m tomcat-server	
	
# CPU Allocation
$ docker run -it --cpus="2" --name jenkins-server ubuntu /bin/bash
$ docker update --cpus="2" jenkins-server


DAY-4:
# Docker Images
=================
Agenda:
	- Understand docker Images and application
	- Advantages of Docker Images
	- Create docker Image for your application
	- Share/publish your Image
	- Examine Docker repositories that hold images

- Docker images are the building blocks for creating container
- From images, we launch containers.

# Advantages of Images in Build and Deployments OR DevOps world!

a. Works In my machine problem.
b. Developers can quickly setup local development environments as we can include all dependencies in the image and create containers.
c. Is there an Issue? don't spend time to troubleshoot it. Just throw the machine which has the issue away and create new instantly.
d. Auto scale your environment very easilly.
e. No need to live with complex, redundant configurations. You can create disposable environments.
f. You can leverage/utilizes local machines's computing power when you need to test your code on multiple machines, instead of waiting for DevOps team to supply or wasting extra computing power. you already have 500GB, 16GB RAM right? are you utilising it? NO! then why again you need extra hardware?
g. You can create new environments within few minutes (ex: create new performance testing environment within few minutes before the release)


# Listing docker images
- $ docker image ls

- Images live in '/var/lib/docker/image/overlay2/imagedb/content/sha256'
- Containers live in '/var/lib/docker/containers'


# Building our own Image
	We have 2 Ways to create docker image:
		1. docker "commit"
		2. docker "build" cmd & Dockerfile

# Creating docker image using "docker commit" command
===========================================================
PROJECT-1:
Goal: Create the docker image to ship the application code along with nginx configurations.

- Create container
	$ docker run -it --name nginx-container ubuntu /bin/bash
	
- Install nginx manually
	$ apt-get update
	$ apt-get install -y nginx

- Deploy some application code into '/var/www/html' (this is deployment path for nginx)
	ex: deploy below index.html as a code
=======
<html>
    <body>
	<h1 style="color:red;">Wiculty Learning Solutions</h1>
    </body> 
</html>
=======

- Create docker image from the container (OR)
- Convert docker container as docker image..
	$ docker commit nginx-container nageshvkn/nginx-img
Syntax: $ docker commit <container-name> <image-name>
	
- Check if image has been created
	$ docker image ls

- Push the newly created image to docker hub
        - Create an account in 'https://hub.docker.com/'.
	$ docker login
	$ docker push nageshvkn/nginx-img

Note: Now you have succussfully containerized your application and published the iamge to DockerHub. Customers can spin millions of new containers using the above docker image.

Note: To verify your image as an user, create a container as shown below. Remove existing image that you have created so that you can abserve image download from Docker hub clearly. (to remove the image.. $ docker rmi nageshvkn/nginx-img)
	$ docker run -it nageshvkn/nginx-img /bin/bash

- Launch the application to test if application is configured along with dependencies.
	http://172.17.0.2:80

Note:
start/stop/restart nginx server:
===========\===========\===========		
$ sudo service nginx start
$ sudo service nginx stop
$ sudo service nginx restart
$ sudo service nginx status

Note:
uninstall nginx using below comamnd
$ sudo apt-get purge nginx nginx-common

Container status - explain create, pause


PROJECT-2:
=============
DAY-6:
# Creating docker image using "docker build" command
=================
	- mkdir gamutgurus
	- cd gamutgurus
	- touch Dockerfile

	--> 'gamutgurus' directory is called "context" or "build context".
		It contains the code, files or other data that you want to include in the 
		image.
	
	- Write Dokckerfile:
		FROM ubuntu:16.04
		MAINTAINER "info@gamutgurus.com"
		RUN apt-get update
		RUN apt-get install -y nginx
		COPY index.html /var/www/html
		ENTRYPOINT service nginx start && bash

index.html:
=======
<html>
   <body style="background-color:powderblue;">
     <h1 style="color:red;">Gamug Gurus Online Training Portal</h1>
	</body> 
</html>
 	
# Building docker image:
	$ cd gamutgurus
	$ docker build -t "nageshvkn/nginx-img" .

Note: Building the image if 'Dockerfile' has different name.
	  Use "-f <YourDockerfileName>" option.
	  Example: $ docker build -f MyDockerfile -t="nageshvkn/nginx-img" .

# Listing docker image
	$ docker image ls

# Create an account in docker hub

# Pushing custom images to docker repository
	$ docker login
	$ docker push nageshvkn/nginx-image

#
Testing Image
1. Remove the local image so that it will be downloaded from Docker Hub.
	$ docker rmi nageshvkn/nginx-image (OR)
	$ docker image rm nageshvkn/nginx-image
 
2. Creating a new container from our image
	$ docker run -it --name nginx-container nageshvkn/nginx-img /bin/bash

Note: start the nginx server manually as it's not fixed yet. It will be fixed in the next topic.

3. Verify if nginx is running from the container.
	$ http://172.17.0.2:80
	
#
User Images Syntax:
	nageshvkn/nginx-img (username/imagename)

Official Images Syntax:
	ubuntu

# Specifying Image via tags
	- ubuntu:16.04
	  ubuntu- is image name
	  16.04 - is called tag


# Deleting an Image
	- docker rmi gamut/nginx

# Deleting all Images
	- docker rmi $(docker images -q)


# Container creation process - Deep dive
  How contaner is created:
		
		Writable Layer		
		-		
		Gamutkart application		
		Apache image
		nginx image
		-		
		Ubuntu Base Image(rootfs)
		-
		Bootfs:
		    cgroups, namespace, lxc, devicemapper/aufs/overlay..etc.
		Kernel


Volumes:
===============
# List all volumes available in host machine
	$ docker volume ls
 
# Create a new Named Volume
	$ docker volume create deployment_code

# Check Mount point directory
	$ docker inspect deployment_code

# Mount Volume(deployment_code) to a new container
	$ docker run -it -v deployment_code:/deployment_code ubuntu:16.04 /bin/bash

# Create 'Read-only' Volumes
	$ docker run -it -v deployment_code:/deployment_code:ro ubuntu:16.04 /bin/bash

# Removing a Volume
	$ docker volume rm deployment_code

# Remove all unused Volumes
	$ docker volume prune

# Note:
Creating host Volume with your own directory in host machine (OR)
Creating host Volume with existing directory in the host machine
	$ docker run -it -v /home/gamut/Distros:/Distros ubuntu /bin/bash

# bind mount
$ docker run -it --mount type=bind,source=/home/gamut/Distros,target=/Distros ubuntu /bin/bash

# List down all containers which are using a particular volume
	$ docker ps -a --filter volume=deployment_code


DAY-8:
